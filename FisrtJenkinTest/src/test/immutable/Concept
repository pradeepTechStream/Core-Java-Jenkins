To create an immutable class in java, you have to do following steps.

Declare the class as final so it can’t be extended.
Make all fields private so that direct access is not allowed.
Don’t provide setter methods for variables
Make all  fields final so that it’s value can be assigned only once.
Initialize all the fields via a constructor performing deep copy.
